How to Install the server

Please setup your firewall on your server prior to running the script.

Make sure you have got access via ssh or otherwise setup prior setting up the firewall, command for UFW is:

ufw allow proto tcp from YOURIP to any port 22

If you have UFW installed use the following commands:

ufw allow 21115:21119/tcp
ufw allow 8000/tcp
ufw allow 21116/udp
sudo ufw enable

Run the following commands:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinger1986/rustdeskinstall/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

Rustdesk windows powershell install script

Generates a powershell script for install grabbing WAN IP and Key currently in /opt/rustdesk but will be moved to a web url for easy deployment.
Tips

If you want to restart the services use the following commands:

sudo systemctl restart rustdesksignal
sudo systemctl restart rustdeskrelay

Client Installation

Before we proceed, make sure that your server has ports open

TCP Ports 21115:21119 and 8000 for http

UDP Port 21116

Now After above Installation, your system is ready. You can now download the client Installation Script using the link of the server which will be displayed once the installation is completed in my case it was as below;

http://rustdesk.syncbricks.com:8000

You will download the script and run that in your computer. For Active Directly you can assign the script to run for all the users.

This is PowerShell Script and needs unrestricted access for unsigned application and then you must restart.
